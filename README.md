This is a browser extension that plays the [Wii Shop Channel theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyjUmv1gJEg) in the background when you visit a shopping website. You can also select the music from the 3DS eShop, DSi Shop, Wii Shop Banner/Home, Wii U eShop, and Coconut Mall.

The extension only requires two permissions: [Tabs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs), to check the URL of the currently-active tab, and [Notifications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Notifications), to show a message after the extension is installed.

**This extension is not developed by, or affiliated with, Nintendo in any way.**
